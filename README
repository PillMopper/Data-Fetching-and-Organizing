**Downloading the data in bulk from the FDA's AERS website**

The AERS files are split into multiple .zip files on these two FDA pages:

http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm083765.htm

This phase simply downloads all of the zip files and organizes them on the local file system.

This uses simple HTML parsing with Nokogiri to get the filename and label.
